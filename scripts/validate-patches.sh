# Validate all patches against an extracted app.asar.contents directory
#
# This script runs each patch on a staged copy of its target WITHOUT modifying
# the extract, allowing you to verify patches will work before running a full
# build.
#
# Patches are applied CUMULATIVELY per target, in the orchestrator's order:
# like scripts/apply_patches.py, every file under patches/{linux,core,community}/
# that carries both an @patch-target and an @patch-type header, sorted by
# BASENAME across the category dirs. Running each patch alone on a pristine
# copy is not enough, because a patch may depend on an earlier patch's end state
# on the same target (add_feature_transcript_limits asserts the worker-host fork
# that add_feature_files_quick_open sub-patch B injects); validated in
# isolation it would FAIL here while the real build passes.
#
# Each resolved target keeps ONE staged state: the stub + chunks concatenation
# for a code-split bundle (staged as apply_patches.py stages it), a copy of the
# directory for nim-dir patches. Each patch runs on a copy of that state; on
# PASS the copy becomes the new state, on FAIL the state is left as it was.
# Unlike the orchestrator, which stops at the first failure, every patch still
# runs and every failure is listed. A patch after a FAIL on the same target sees
# the last good state, so one failure can cascade into the patches that build on
# it: fix the first FAIL per target first.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/validate-patches.sh <app.asar.contents_path> [path_to_deb_tree]
#   ./scripts/validate-patches.sh                         # Uses current dir
#
# Example workflow:
#   1. Download and extract Claude Desktop
#   2. Extract app.asar: asar extract app.asar app.asar.contents
#   3. Run: ./scripts/validate-patches.sh ./app.asar.contents
