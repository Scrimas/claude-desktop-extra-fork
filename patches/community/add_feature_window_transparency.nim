# Translucent main window, opt-in (default OFF): `windowTransparency` in
# claude-desktop-extra.json(c), switched from Settings -> Extra -> Community
# Features, or CLAUDE_WINDOW_TRANSPARENCY=1|0; `windowOpacity` (0.1..1, default
# 0.8) / CLAUDE_WINDOW_OPACITY sets how see-through the surfaces are; the
# Settings row's slider changes it live. Blur behind the window is left to the
# compositor (Hyprland, KWin, ...).
#
# Two sub-patches:
#   A. js/window_transparency.js injected at the head of the main bundle:
#      the options hook, the theme-flip guards, the CSS injection with its live
#      opacity swap, and the Settings IPC handlers.
#   B. The main window's options literal gets `...globalThis.__cdbWinTransExtra()`
#      spliced in right after upstream's `backgroundColor:<fn>(),opacity:<v>,`
#      pair. It spreads AFTER backgroundColor, so its `transparent` and
#      `backgroundColor` keys win (last key wins in a JS object literal), and the
#      pair itself is left untouched: patches/linux/fix_native_frame.nim matches
#      `backgroundColor:<fn>(),opacity:` too. The window FACTORY is deliberately
#      not rewritten - fix_profile_window_title and fix_window_bounds anchor on
#      its exact shape.
#
# transparent is a BrowserWindow constructor option, so toggling needs an app
# RESTART. It requires a frameless window and is skipped when the native
# titlebar is on.
#
# Break risk: LOW for A (stable "use strict"; head anchor). B anchors on the key
# order `backgroundColor:<fn>(),opacity:<v>,icon:` in the main window's options
# literal - the same backgroundColor/opacity pair fix_native_frame anchors on -
# with every identifier a wildcard; a reorder fails loud (match count != 1).
